# vs_calc_01
This is just the arithmetic/logic unit of a bigger project (NSIBIDI). It has +80,000 lines of brute codes.
This project is my experiment with the potentency of Java script with zero 'plug-ins'.
It aims to build a computing machine capable of complex logical analysis, driven by 'original logic' from scratch.
As at current, project is a computing interface capable of 'binary computations'.
